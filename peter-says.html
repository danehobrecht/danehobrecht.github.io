			<summary>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE</summary>
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;A low-stimulus environment is characterized by the minimal sensory stimuli and the lack of interactions due to social isolations. These factors can cause the development of delirium, the state of confusion and reduced consciousness and cognitive abilities, often leading to other serious complications. Studies actually show that one and every three older adults who experience delirium in the hospital will have another episode after discharge which will lead to hospital readmission<sup>1</sup>. In an environment with low sensory stimuli such as visual, auditory, and isolation will cause disorientation and confusion as the brain relies on a steady flow of sensory information to maintain cognitive function and awareness. The lack of social interaction reduces the essential cognitive stimulation resulting in individuals experiencing anxiety and depression which can contribute to delirium.<br> 
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;Cognitive tests are an essential tool to help assess the mental status and condition of patients. They can help with the diagnosis and identification of any cognitive or neurological impairments, delirium, or even dementia. There are many tests that are used such as the mini- mental state examination (MMSE) for orientation and memory, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) for memory and language, and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for delirium and confusion. These tests allow physicians and healthcare professionals to monitor any mental or physical cognitive changes that can be caused by factors like infections, side effects of medications or anesthesia, or age. Identifying these underlying conditions in an efficient manner can help improve the overall healthcare quality and patient outcomes.<br>
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;The problem of delirium is intellectually interesting as it shows significant clinical relevance. Up to 62% of patients discharged from the ICU have significant cognitive impairment that is “not associated with severity of illness, number of comorbidities, or length of hospital stay<sup>2</sup>.” Researchers advocated that “assessing patients’ orientation to person, place, time, and situation and their ability to follow simple single-step commands like squeezing a hand is a great start to identifying obvious cognitive deficits” but subtle changes to cognitive function require different assessment tools that are not implemented regularly in hospitals<sup>2</sup>. It’s especially important to monitor delirium in dementia patients. It’s found that delirium development in dementia patients may accelerate the trajectory of their cognitive decline and result in long lengths of stay, readmissions, premature nursing home placement or death<sup>3</sup>. Delirium also proves to affect the care and performance hospitals are evaluated on. It’s associated with many adverse outcomes like increased mortality rates, falls, functional decline, cognitive impairment and decline, and significant costs<sup>4</sup>. It also puts a major financial burden as medical services and costs range from $38 to $152 billion per year nationwide<sup>5</sup>. Addressing delirium in the clinical setting is of interest to many hospitals in order to prevent adverse health outcomes and unnecessary medical and administrative costs during a patient’s stay.

			<summary>EXISTING SOLUTIONS AND GAP ANALYSIS</summary>
			<br><u>Existing Solutions</u>
			<br><br><i>Alert and Oriented Assessment</i><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;During initial patient assessment, nurses will perform an alert and oriented (A&O) assessment. The nurse will assess the patient’s level of consciousness by noting their response to the nurse's introduction<sup>6</sup>. Following this, the nurse will evaluate the patient’s memory and cognitive abilities by asking questions related to the patient’s identity, location, time, and current events<sup>6</sup>.  The assessment is not as complex as the formal cognitive tests performed by neurologists, but it provides a quick and concise consensus of a patient’s neurological function. 
			<br><br><i>Standardized Cognitive Assessments</i><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;There are a multitude of neuropsychological screening tools that hospitals use in determining the neurological status of a patient. Some examples are the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)<sup>7</sup>. Both of these exams are used to determine if the patient has cognitive impairment. The MMSE is used if the patient seems confused because of a head injury or illness to see if the brain was affected<sup>8</sup>. The MoCA can also be used for this purpose, particularly when the patient is in a clinical state that could progress to dementia<sup>9</sup>.
			<br><br><i>Cognitive Exercises</i><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;These applications engage users in exercises that can assess cognitive function. Some are tailored towards clinical environments. Some examples include NeuronUp and RehaCom which are used for neurorehabilitation and improving cognitive function<sup>10,11</sup>. NeuronUp is a digital web platform with exercises, tools, and real-life simulators created to improve the cognitive function of patients dealing with brain injury and Alzheimer’s-type dementia10. Clinicians can not only track a patient’s progress, but personalize the interface to fit the patient’s goals and current neurological abilities. RehaCom can assist “the therapist in the rehabilitation of cognitive disorders”<sup>11</sup>. The software is used by clinicians to design and implement individualized cognitive training programs, monitor patient progress, and adjust treatment plans based on specific therapeutic goals. There are interfaces that currently aren’t constructed for clinical settings but strive for the same goals. For example, Lumosity is a website where individuals can improve their memory, processing speed, and problem solving skills<sup>12</sup>.
			<br><br><i>Hospital Socialization</i><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;To increase patient engagement, hospitals recruit volunteers and implement rooms where patients can interact with each other in order to foster social connections, reduce feelings of isolation, and promote mental well-being. In a study it was evident that the presence of volunteers can have a positive impact on patient health outcomes related to nutrition, falls and delirium<sup>13</sup>.
			<br><br><u>Gap Analysis</u>
			<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;"Peter Says" is a unique and versatile tool designed to address the gap in low-stimulus hospital environments where patients are at risk of delirium and cognitive decline. By providing an engaging, multiplayer platform, it increases patient interaction and social engagement, helping to reduce feelings of isolation and improve cognitive function. The device collects cognitive data, creating a baseline for diagnoses and offering clinicians continuous feedback on a patient’s cognitive status. It also serves as a self-explanatory cognitive test, relieving some of the nurses' workload by allowing cognitive assessments to be conducted independently. By doing so, "Peter Says" enhances patient care and reduces the likelihood of cognitive issues being overlooked, thereby mitigating risks associated with prolonged hospital stays in low-stimulus environments. Additionally, "Peter Says" facilitates communication between patients and their families, further enhancing social connections that are crucial for mental well-being during hospital stays. Its ability to function without constant nurse intervention ensures that cognitive monitoring is maintained even when staff resources are limited, making it a valuable addition to the standard care routine.

			<summary>PROPOSED SOLUTION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION</summary>
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;"Peter Says" is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to recall and replicate sequences of lights and sounds using a circular, handheld device with four large, colored buttons—in this case, an ascending gradient of blue—each emitting a unique tone. Beyond its traditional role as an engaging game, "Peter Says" serves as a versatile tool in clinical settings. It fills the gaps in low-stimulus environments often found in hospitals, where patients are at risk of delirium and secondary falls due to reduced sensory engagement. By keeping patients mentally and physically engaged, "Peter Says" helps clinicians monitor cognitive function and awareness over time. The device doubles as a wake detector, patient benchmarking software, and clinician-facing check-in service, providing continuous feedback on the patient’s cognitive status. This multi-functional approach not only enhances patient care but also helps mitigate risks associated with prolonged hospital stays in low-stimulus environments.

			<summary>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS</summary>
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;Our group recognized the importance of focusing on existing products and seeking ways to enhance them. The design we developed was the result of collaborative brainstorming, where we explored innovative features and functionalities that would separate our product from others on the market and make it a valuable tool for doctors. By accomplishing this, we would ensure that the full capabilities of Peter Says would be utilized to give patients comfort and lead to their recovery. We also learned that there’s a need for further cognitive assessment in the clinical setting. Our research suggests that the vast capabilities of human cognition are under-researched, potentially leading to future challenges in providing adequate patient care. By implementing our product, we strive to further broaden the boundaries of our knowledge of human cognition. By the same token, we learned the importance of health informatics in providing cutting-edge technology for the betterment of patients. Our group consists of majors of all backgrounds, and we each gained valuable insights from collaborating. For instance, the business economics majors in our group initially had limited knowledge about the effects of delirium, but by the end of the project, they had developed a deep understanding of its significance and the critical need to find solutions to this escalating issue. Conversely, health informatics majors gained insight into the most effective marketing strategies to establish a successful market presence for Peter Says. By working in unison, we cultivated a deeper comprehension of the vitality of health informatics and its continuous efforts to improve patient healthcare.
			<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Peter Says is limited by being available only on a dedicated handheld device rather than as an application on digital devices. This can present challenges to the accessibility of the product in the current modernized tech world. A type of limitation we had regarding the Peter Says application process was with the validity of the patient data. Our product depends on patient participation. If we only collect data from those who choose to participate, it either compromises the validity of our data or provides insufficient information to generalize to the broader patient population. Another limitation of our project was the limited time we had to complete it. Although we set our deadlines for the objectives we wanted to achieve, the 5-week duration of the class made it difficult to hit those deadlines and only allowed us to develop a prototype and mockup website, limiting the scope of our ideas and research. 
			<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Our plans include focusing on enhancing the functionality and usability of the website through subsequent testing and design revisions. This would permit our group to conduct research and explore methods for integrating our product and its features into the healthcare sector and beyond. However, since our application is currently just a prototype, we are still in the development phase of our project. To advance it further, we will need to recruit additional individuals with coding expertise. For instance, our visit to the Beall Applied Innovation Lab at UC Irvine has provided valuable insights into how to present our product to developers and access the resources needed to advance to the next stage of Peter Says’ development. By achieving this, we could expand on our product by implementing additional features, such as a collaboration directly with clinics and their patients to tackle the issue of limited access to medically assisted clinics and the absence of withdrawal data, or the introduction of a seamless multiplayer feature that allows patients to compete with each other or with themselves, enhancing both their enjoyment of the hospital stay and their cognitive well-being.
